About Me
------
I am a 6th year PhD candidate at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.  I earned a M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Lehigh University. I also earned a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Music from Moravian College (now Moravian University).  My primary research direction is relating applied statistics to algorithmic music composition.   My secondary research direction involves using probability theory to study optimal strategies for playing on TV game shows.
