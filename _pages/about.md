About Me
------
I am a 6th year PhD candidate at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.  I earned a M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Lehigh University. I also earned a B.S. in Mathematics (with honors) and a B.A. in Music from Moravian College (now Moravian University).  My primary research direction is relating applied statistics to algorithmic music composition.   My secondary research direction involves using probability theory to study optimal strategies for playing on TV game shows. In my spare time, I enjoy practicing piano and composing music.

Algorithmic Music Composition
------
I use Guided Markov Chains (GMC) in order to compose sequences of chords following the style of Bach chorales.  This approach provides an improvement over exisiting models such as the standard Markov chain (SMC) because it allows the composer direct control over the phrase lengths and the sentiment of the music at each chord.  This model also provides an improvement over neural networks which are complicated to modify if the composer wishes to change his/her compositional preferences to reflect a different style of music.  I have shown that GMC models increase the likelihood of observing a given sequence of chords Bach used when compared with the SMC.  I have also shown that using a guiding variable in a Markov chain exponentially reduces the number of typical sequences of chords.

TV Game Shows 
------
The game show Lucky 13 differs from other television game shows in that contestants are required to place a bet on their own knowledge of trivia by selecting a range that contains the number of questions that they answered correctly. We present a model for this game show using binomial random variables and generate tables outlining the optimal range the player should select based on maximization of two different utility functions. After analyzing the decisions made by some actual contestants on this show, we present a numerical simulation for how many questions an average player is expected to answer correctly based on question categories observed for twelve sample contestants.  This is joint work with Prof. Daniel Conus at Lehigh University.
